I love playing with counterfactuals. . . I know a lot of people will say they're an excercise in futility, but I think they're wrong. My justification for this came in the same flash of insight

I always assumed that runners high was just a general good feeling you get when you start running out of juice and your body throws out some euphoria as if to say, "All right, that's an accomplishment cool your jets" and then you can all hug and sign a D.A.R.E. pledge together. At mile 7 of a steep trail run where I lightly bonked by the second mile, I realized I was very wrong. Now if I imagine a world where Richard Nixon decided to take a day off of presiding every week to hit the trails, I have to believe that distance running would be a schedule I controlled substance.

I didn't hallucinate any small men playing cello in the forest. I didn't watch the birth of time or a battle of the bands between heaven and hell. I did see a few colors in the shade when I passed it, and when I stopped to rest once I was floored by the beauty of the wind making waves in the grass on the hillside opposite me. I stood there for a long time, I felt a sense of connectedness to the rest of the world and a dissolution of my ego that comes from being out of your mind high. When I turned back to the trail and ran again, I had one flash of insight that stuck with me more than any I've had actually doing drugs: the thinking mind is reflective rather than directive.
